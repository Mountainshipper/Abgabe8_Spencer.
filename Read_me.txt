If anything is unclear, I have created two tutorial videos. A tutorial for the database and one for the app :) 


Database:
https://dashboard.back4app.com/apps

Login Via Github ("I will change the password in a view days :) ")
samuel.spencer@edu.fh-joanneum.at
The_Big_Project




Go to Projekt Joanneum
Then Database: All_Works which represent are all Projects
Database:      New User which represent are all Users

If the app crashes, please check if the database says "undefined" anywhere. This usually leads to an error. sorry for that. It is a rare known error!


Project

Unzip project folder.
Theme size setting is Tablet. 10.5 Zoll 1600x2560 Android 11

Start The App.

You will then see the student registration.
You can create an account or switch to login.

Login
There are three login Interfaces. Example login.  
Otherwise you can fetch the users from the database

Student: 	austrian_spencer2@outlook.com 		Pas 12345
Assistant: 	austrian_spencer@outlook.com 		Pas 12345
Admin:	 	Administrator@outlook.com		Pas 12345

Assistant is the professor.
Password is always 12345.
Have Fun ^^
